Miwok App
===================================

This app displays lists of vocabulary words for the user to learn the Miwok language.
Used in a Udacity course in the Beginning Android Nanodegree.

My app
===================================

I have made my own app to learn the ancient Miwok language with the help of Udacity's *Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps by Google.* This online course can be found [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-multiscreen-apps--ud839).

You can download and install my app via the following link on the Google Play Store.
